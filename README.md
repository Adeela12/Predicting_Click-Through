# Predicting_Click-Through
Applying machine learning techniques to maximize the click-through for the presented choices, where a click indicates a visitor’s interest and potentially a decision to book.

# Problem Statement<br>

At the core of hotel personalization and ranking is the challenge of matching a set of hotels to a set of travelers whose tastes are heterogeneous and sometimes unobserved. The accuracy of the match depends on how online travel agencies (OTA) leverage their available information such as given hotel characteristics, location attractiveness of hotels, users aggregated purchase history and competitors’ information, and among others, to infer travelers preferences for hotels. For example, Hotels.com does this by compiling a customer’s search criteria to present the most competitive offerings for their needs at the top of the list of results when they make a travel query.
